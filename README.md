Hyscorean
==========

Hyscorean is an open-source package of EleXsys and MATLAB software with graphical user-interface for acquiring non-uniform sampled HYSCORE data and for analyzing, both, uniform and non-uniform HYSCORE data, including validation and EasySpin-based fitting. For more information see the [open-access publication](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmr.2019.106576).
